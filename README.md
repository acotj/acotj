## About Me

My name is **Jose Julian L. Acot** and I am currently taking up **Computer Engineering** at **Mapua University**.

One of my goals is to become a software developer, but this may change as I have many interests in life. Mapua University will help guide me in discovering what I am truly passionate about.
